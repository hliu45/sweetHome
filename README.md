information about my room

Hi, I'm looking for people to fill out my room starting from early December. It's located in Milpitas, CA.
It's a homestay. Besides landlady and her husband and grandma, you have other four roommates(mostly SJSU students).

Rent is $1000/mo and it covers almost everything (Meals, utilities, furniture). You can have dinner with other family member and roommates at night. You still can cook for yourself, but you have to clean the kitchen yourself after using it. Breakfast is self-serve, and you will wash the dishes after the regular scheduled dinner. Just bring the plate to the kitchen. The landlady will clean the house once a month. Besides the room of your own, you'll have shared bathroom, living room and kitchen with other roommates. It's is about 15-20mins walk from Great Mall/bus stop and its near highway 237 and 880.

It locates in a quiet and safe community. It's a good place for people who focus on their study and don't have time to prepare meals and clean the house and kitchen. Please msg me if you need more details.
Thank you.
