Sally's house is located in Milpitas, CA near highway 237 and 880. It's in a quiet and safe community. It's a homestay with total 8 rooms and a beautiful garden. Besides landlady and her husband and grandma, you have other four roommates(mostly SJSU students, 2 from Korea, 1 from China, 1 from Malaysia).

Rent is $1000/mo and it covers almost everything (Meals, utilities, internet, air conditioner). You can join dinner with other family member and roommates. You still can cook for yourself, but you have to clean the kitchen yourself after using it. Breakfast is self-serve, and you will wash the dishes after the regular scheduled dinner. Just bring the plate to the kitchen. The landlady will clean the house on regular basis. So it mostly remains clean and ordered. Besides the room of your own, you have shared a bathroom, living room and kitchen with other roommates. You are welcome to use the kitchen appliance. It usually provides milk and orange juice all year around. You can watch movies(Netflix) in the living rooms. You also have a TV in your room and all the furniture are also included.

It's is about 15-20mins walk from Great Mall/bus stop and is near Safeway and Ranch 99. There are also many restaurants nearby. The food the homestay provided range from Asian style (Filipino food, Vietnamese food, Chinese food), Mexican food, traditional American food. There usually have fruits and dessert served after the dinner.

It's a good place for people who focus on their study or work and don't have time to prepare meals themselves. Please msg me if you need more details.

Thank you.
